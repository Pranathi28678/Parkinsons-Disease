## Introduction

This project is a Parkinson's disease prediction system that leverages machine learning algorithms to provide a classification based on the input data. The model is trained using features extracted from a dataset of individuals, some of whom have Parkinson's disease.

## Installation

To run the script, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pranathi28678/parkinsons_disease_prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd parkinsons_disease_prediction
```

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python parkd.py
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named `Parkinson_disease.csv`. It contains various features such as biomedical voice measurements to distinguish healthy individuals from those with Parkinson's disease.

## Model Training

The script includes code for training a machine learning model using the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Selection
3. Model Training (using Support Vector Machine - SVM)
4. Model Evaluation

## Results

The results of the model training and evaluation are displayed within the script, including accuracy scores for both the training and testing datasets.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.
